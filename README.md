SQL Project to analyze the company layoff dataset 

# INTRODUCTION
This is a SQL project created to have an analysis on the layoff dataset of different companies in the year of 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023.

In this project, I followed the given steps to do the Data Cleaning of the initial dataset 
* Removing the duplicates
* Standardizing the data
* Removing the Null Values or Blank Values
* Removing the columns which are unnecessary

Further, I used the clean data to do the Exploratory Data Analysis on the company layoffs for the given 4 years.
